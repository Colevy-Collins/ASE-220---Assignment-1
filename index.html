			My name is Colevy Collins. I would like to describe my self as a hard working individual.
		I am from Powell county KY, and this will be my first semester here at NKU. I transferred from MCTC
		(Maysville community and technical college) with a soon to be awarded associate degree in programming
		I love the idea of creating useful and productive tools, which lead me to interest in programming. Truly
		there are no limits on what you can create with software, and I hope to learn how to create it.
		I am hoping to have a more social college experience at NKU without having to move or commute for 2 hours 
		there and 2 hours back. This is due to having all online courses at MCTC, where groups and group work was not used.
		I am a little anti social, but part of the college experience is to socialize. 
	<p>
	
	
	<h2>Why am I here at NKU?</h2>
	
	<p>   <p/>
	
	<p>
		I have transferred to NKU to obtain a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I am also minoring in computer since.
	<p/>
	
	<h2>Other Information</h2>
	
	<p>   <p/>
	
	<p>
			This is not the first web page I had to create for a class. At MCTC, I had web page development and data-driven web page.
		The first class is what I am using for this current web page. It dealt more with HTML and the CSS, and other components.
		The second class was more about linking a web page to a database and using a web server. In that class, we used Apache web server,
		MySQL, JSON, and Javascript.
	<p/>
	<p>
		
			I also know the basics of 3 programming languages. I have studied Phyton, Java, and C#. As a bonus, I know a little
		VB (Visual Basic) from the pre-req class I had to take before the real programming classes. On top of that, I have worked 
		with 3 IDE; Wing101, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.
	<p/>
	<p>
			My hobby is playing video games. My preferred genres are RTS (real-time strategy) and survival/creative games. Some examples 
		of RTS games are supreme commander 2 and, although not in real-time, CIV6. In the several categories, we have State of Decay 2
		Space Engineers and, of course, Minecraft. 
	<p/>
	
	<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
